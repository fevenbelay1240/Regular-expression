# Regular-expression

## Pattern Matching and Regular Expressions
This project uses the Java's _regex_ package to look for patterns and match with what we are looking for. 

### For reference, these are some of the matching characters used in regular expressions
• \d is just one of many metacharacters supported by Java’s regex system. Here are the other predefined character classes:
• \D – any non-digit character
• \w – any letter, number, or underscore
• \W – anything other than a letter, number, or underscore 
• \s – any whitespace character
• \S – any non-whitespace character
• . (a period) – any character

### pattern looking by repetition 
• * – 0 or more repetitions of preceding
• + – 1 or more repetitions of preceding
• {x,y} – between x and y more repetitions of preceding 
• ? – 0 or 1 repetitions of preceding
